Meeting on 3/2/2023

Nikhil
My role was a Moderator.

As a moderator I asked the team :

1. What are they working on?
2. Is there any roadblock?
3. Do you have enough work till next meeting?
4. Do you require any resources?
5. Do you have any suggestion for existing design?

Since being new mid-sized company I thought of asking few more questions than normal.
